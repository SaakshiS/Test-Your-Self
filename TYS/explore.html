      data-text="Test your memory with this Memory Card game. The rule of the game is very simple, you have to match all the pairs of identical cards or to find as many pairs as possible. Each turn, you can only turn over 2 cards. If you can't find a pair, the flipped cards will be flipped back with the face down. Try to remember these images as it becomes easier to find pairs the longer you play.">

The order that you click the letters will be the order that they appear in the blank boxes. When you're satisfied with your guess, press the 'CHECK WORD' button to see if you've succeeded. If you won't be able to guess in th e given time a timer will show by revealing the word. Speed counts, so try to unscramble the letters as quickly as possible..!!">
